### Adaptive Cards Community Calls

Welcome to our Adaptive Cards community call series for 2019, the 2nd Thursday of each month. We are excited to provide you with a monthly opportunity to learn about Adaptive Cards in general, how they could be a great tool in your applications and contribute to the evolution of the format and SDKs. Each month, weâ€™ll discuss new features we are bringing to the platform, our roadmap, and listen to your feedback and suggestions.
