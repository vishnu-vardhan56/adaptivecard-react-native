Welcome to our Adaptive Cards community call series for 2020, the 2nd Thursday of each month. We are excited to provide you with a monthly opportunity to learn about Adaptive Cards in general, how they could be a great tool in your applications and contribute to the evolution of the format and SDKs. Each month, we'll discuss new features we are bringing to the platform, our roadmap, and listen to your feedback and suggestions.

Agenda for this month's call, hosted by Matt Hidinger, included:

Build 2020 and a look at the Roadmap
------------------------------------

Build 2020 was all-virtual this year, and we had the opportunity to share the latest and greatest coming to Adaptive Cards on the [YouTube session](https://aka.ms/m365sk134). The session focused on four areas, outlined below.

### Adaptive Card Templating and Designer Updates

Templating helps you save time by easily populating reusable card templates with data. [Release Candidate SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/templating/sdk) are now available for .NET and JavaScript, and we plan to make them Generally Available in the coming weeks. We also added rich data-binding support in the [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer) to make it even faster to design new cards based on your data payloads.

### Adaptive Cards v2: Universal Actions

Next we officially unveiled Adaptive Cards v2, which adds a new "universal action model" to Adaptive Cards, making it possible to create actionable cards that can communicate with a backend server in a standard way, whether those cards are in Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Cortana Skills, or anywhere else.

Stay tuned to this space, as we'll have plenty more to share on this topic throughout the year.

### Card Author Services

Lastly, we discussed a recent additional to the Adaptive Cards family: the "[Adaptive Cards CMS](https://adaptivecards.io/blog/2020/Community-Call-April/)" or "Card Author Services".

This product offers a centralized place to create, manage, share, and use card templates for your own apps or the entire organization. It includes a user-friendly card management portal, configurable storage and authentication, and a REST API for accessing your cards. We're still working on the final name and release plan, but the good news is this project is still in development and we hope to have a preview that is available this summer. We also welcome community support and contributions if this is something that interests you.

### Putting it all together

Here's a look at each of our major investment areas and what to expect for the rest of 2020 and throughout 2021.
